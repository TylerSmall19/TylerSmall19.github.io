	<h1>Best places to eat in Chicago</h1>

<article>
	<p>On the search for some great places to eat in Chicago? Well look no further. I've compiled my experiences from 4 months in Chicago, working in the industry, and eating out on visits. This list may be slightly biased, but I can promise each restaurant listed will be among the top 5 best meals you've ever eaten. Let's begin.

		This place is probably one of the top places in Chicago, and especially considering the cost per plate doesn't make you <em>feel</em> like you're eating at an amazingly fancy restaurant, but rather a moderately upscale eatery in Chicago. It's not cheap, but it certainly won't break the pocket book if you know what you want going in. I'd recommend going with a group of friends, since every plate is shared, and bringing a healthy appetite.

		With publican, there's really no going wrong. Checkout their <a href="http://www.thepublicanrestaurant.com/#pork-beer-oysters">website</a> for reservation details, and to check out the menu before you go.
